# libsbml-build-scripts
Scripts and utilities used to build and deploy a libSBML release

Common build tools and documentation are kept in the master while machine specific configurations files and build scripts are stored in branches which should not be deleted:

* compartment
* constraint
* delay
* oldmac
* raterule
* rule
* species

further branches should be named appropriately.
