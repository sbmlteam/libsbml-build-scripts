# libSBML build configuration files for Python and MATLAB bindings

This collection contains the build chain configurations needed to build libSBML Python and MATLAB release packages.
While they mirror those on raterule they have been updated to use VS2015 and newer CMAKE etc. Note that that there is a divergence
of the configuration code between libsbml\dev and libsbml-with-packages\dev which must be maintained.
