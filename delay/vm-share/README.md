## VMware share files
The files in this folder are for creating the linux binaries. These shell scripts are to be invoked directly from the VMs. 

Please don't remove them :)

### PREREQUISITES

NOTE: Since the OS used by these VMs are old and use an SVN version no longer supported by SourceForge you must update C:\vm-share\libsbml \nd C:\vm-share\libsbml-experimental folders before doing anything else.
