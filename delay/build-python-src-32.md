# Delay Windows/Python build

Create the complete set of all 32/64 bit standalone installers, PyPI wheels and Anaconda packages from local libSBML source repositories for various Python distributions. Requires various Python versions each with setuptools, pip and wheel packages and swig in the system path. The `build-python` directory occurs in two places but only needs to be run from the one located in the stable 32 bit source tree.
