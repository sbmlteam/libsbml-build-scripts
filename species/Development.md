This directory includes the scripts and source for the nightly build files.

Make sure dev/utilites/python_package is updated when packages are added/modifies in stable/experimental

Added the build_python_anaconda tools. The only way I could get this to work was to update the meta.yml
files with the current release information. In terms of experimental this will have to change for the next
release (>5.17.0) the filename python-libsbml_experimental --> python-libsbml-experimental
