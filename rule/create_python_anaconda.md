# Create Python anaconda
This directory contains instructions and scripts for creating and uploading the Python Anaconda package

Added the build_python_anaconda tools. The only way I could get this to work was to update the meta.yaml 
files with the current release information. In terms of experimental this will have to change for the next 
release (>5.17.0) the filename python-libsbml_experimental --> python-libsbml-experimental


## Folder location

Can be run from any location, outside of Dropbox folder, but by default this is setup to run in ~/Development
